# Object_Detection_for_Crime_Scene_Evidence_Analysis_Using_Deep_Learning

## Abstract: Object detection is the key module in most visual based surveillance applications and security systems. In crime scene analysis, the images and videos play a signiﬁcant role in providing visual documentation of a scene. It allows police oﬃcers to recreate a scene for later analysis by detecting objects related to a speciﬁc crime. However, due to the presence of a large volume of data, the task of detecting objects of interest is very tedious for law enforcement agencies. In this work, I present a Yolov4 (You Only Look Once) model based real-time system, which automatically detects objects which might be found in an indoor environment. To test the eﬀectiveness of the proposed system, I applied it to a subset of Image containing 4 object classes which is downlaod form various websites. I achieved an average accuracy of 86.33%.

### Summary of worked I did for this project
####    - 1 Step: Web Scraping
####    - 2 Step: Data Annonation
####    - 3 Step: Data Augmentation
####    - 4 Step: Training of YoloV4 model on Google colab
####    - 5 Step: Testing on Images
####    - 6 Step: Testing on Live Streaming

##Suggestions are always welcome, thank you!
